# Rosalind Problems

This repo contains my solutions to the bioinformatics problems found on [rosalind.info](rosalind.info). I got hooked on these problems after doing the first 16 within 24 hours of finding the site.

### Files

- `solutions.R`
	- This is the file containing all my solutions. Each problem has a title, a function to solve it, and a call to that function for convenience.
	- There are also helper functions in this file
- `useful_charts`
	- This folder contains some charts provided by [rosalind.info](rosalind.info) to help solve the problems.

### FAQ

- **Why did you use R instead of Python?**
	- I'm a statistician by training, and R is the language I'm most comfortable with. 
	- That being said, I can tell some of these problems have more elegant solutions in Python. I'm not opposed to redoing some/all of these in Python at some point. I'm not anti-Python, I'm just pro-R :).
- **Rosalind.info has a lot of problems on it. Which ones are these?**
	- These problems are from the "Bioinformatics Stronghold" problem bank. I may do other banks at some point.
- **Why are all your solutions in one file? Why not have each solution in its own file?**
	- I prefer keeping everything in one place so that I can search through my previous answers easily. I also don't want to repeat the same `library()` and `source()` commands over and over in multiple files.
- **Why aren't the problems in order?**
	- Because I didn't do them in order. 
	- They *are* still roughly in order of ascending difficulty, since [rosalind.info](rosalind.info) enforces this (a feature I quite enjoyed!)
